 					<p>Twenty-five years ago, RadonAway introduced to the radon industry the first radon-specific fan. Since then, our fans have become the most popular, reliable and effective radon fans in the world. We continue our commitment to meet the needs of the radon mitigation industry by providing high quality fans, accessories and supplies backed by rapid, courteous technical support and service. All of the products we manufacture, including radon fans, blowers, and AIRaider™ Systems for radon in water, are made in the USA of U.S. and imported parts.</p><p>RadonAway is a brand of Spruce Environmental Technologies, Inc., an ENERGY STAR Partner, which was founded with the purpose of making indoor air safer. Besides RadonAway radon mitigation fans and related products, Spruce also manufactures Spruce brand inline ventilation fans and AccuStar® and RadStar radon testing devices. In 2012, Spruce acquired RCI, a highly regarded, 27-year-old radon mitigation supplies distributor.</p>

   				<div class="desc">For most homes, the mitigator will follow three steps to reduce airborne radon: diagnostic evaluation, sealing and installation of the airborne radon reduction system. The most commonly installed type of system uses active soil depressurization (ASD), formerly called sub-slab depressurization (SSD). Another method involves the installation of a heat recovery ventilator. The radon mitigator will design the right system for your home, depending on its design, the underlying soil, and other factors.<a href ="http://www.radonaway.com/fixing-a-radon-problem.php"> You can find more info here.</a></div>

   				<div class="desc">In general, a certified radon mitigator who is experienced in waterborne radon reduction will: assess the waterborne radon level; recommend full water analysis to determine the presence of other contaminants; check the water flow rate; and determine the best system location, taking into consideration plumbing, electrical and venting requirements as well as your preferences. There are two most commonly used types of waterborne radon reduction systems: aeration and granular activated carbon (GAC). A primary factor in choosing between these systems is the radon level. The EPA, for example, does not recommend GAC for radon levels above 5,000 pCi/L.<a href="http://www.radonaway.com/fixing-a-radon-problem.php"> You can find more info here.</a></div>

   				<div class="desc">The aeration method is considered by the EPA to be the best available technology (BAT). It does not pose the threat of waste buildup that other methods, such as GAC, might pose. Aeration separates the radon gas from the well water, then vents the contaminants safely above the roofline. A GAC system uses one, two or three carbon beds or tanks onto which the radon is adsorbed. When properly installed and serviced, it can be effective. If used improperly or if the tanks are left in place too long, the carbon may become ineffective and/or may become a source of radioactivity. For this reason, it is necessary to service GAC systems by changing one tank (or more, depending on the system) annually. <a href="http://www.radonaway.com/fixing-a-radon-problem.php"> You can find more info here.</a></div>
