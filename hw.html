				<div class="ding">
					<p>On February 14, 2013 the Boston ABC-TV affiliate, WCVB, telecast a news report on radon. The report, which was a result of the recent "Capital Steps to Radon Action" CanSAR event at the State House in Boston, gave state and national radon statistics and included interviews with Capital Steps organizer Margie Lynch and David Rossinow, a home inspector and event participant. (For more details on the Capital Steps event, see the previous News post by scrolling down on this page.) During this news segment, Rossinow explained radon testing methods and demonstrated the use of a continuous radon monitor, using a RadStar RS800 for his demonstration; an AccuStar LS air test kit was among the short-term tests shown later in the report. Toward the end of the segment the focus turned to radon mitigation, with the camera showing a portion of an installed radon mitigation system, including a view of the system pipe, where a RadonAway Dynameter u-tube manometer was clearly visible.</p><p>Advocates in Massachusetts gathered at the State House steps in Boston on Wednesday, January 30, to help promote radon awareness and action. This was the first time that Massachusetts supporters joined with advocates in other states to participate in the annual "Capital Steps to Radon Action" event organized by Cancer Survivors Against Radon (CanSAR), www.cansar.org. State Representative Kate Hogan met with the group on the steps to discuss the need for legislative action against radon. Among the Massachusetts group were three Spruce staff members: Melanie Gray and Tina D’Intinosanto of AccuStar Labs in Medway and Pat Everett, Marketing Services Manager for all Spruce brands.</p>
